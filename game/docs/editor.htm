            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Walkthrough 
              for using the editor your first time</b></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCC99">Start 
              it up. You'll find a green looking 3d landscape in a small window 
              and a log window. You can drag the corners to resize everything 
              so go ahead and do this to make the 3d window pretty big.</font> 
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Click 
              Zone-&gt;Load and load &quot;graveyard.zon&quot; from the &quot;data&quot; 
              dir. (this should be the default dir it starts you in)</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You 
              should see the graveyard level. Ignore the errors in the debug log, 
              it's complaing about variables or functions missing that are only 
              available in the game itself, not the editor. Practicing zooming 
              around the level with the camera keys shown at startup. (These are 
              my FPS keys, sorry they are weird)</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hey, 
              let's make our own level! First delete all entities on the screen. 
              Click Zone-&gt;Delete All Ents.</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCC99">Click 
              Zone-&gt;Create. Accept the defaults and click Create. You'll see 
              a big stupid flat landscape. Let's add some hills. Click Zone-&gt;Terraform. 
              Accept the default and click Terraform!. You now have a really bumpy 
              landscape!</font> 
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCC99">Let's 
              create a big mountain or something. Click Window-&gt;Open Landscape 
              Tool.</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCC99">Hold 
              down the left mouse button and drag it over the landscape. Cool! 
              Smooth doesn't work yet, but set does.</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCC99">Let's 
              paint some tiles to the ground. Click Window-&gt;Open Texture tool. 
              Click a few squares. Uncheck paste full tiles only and you can paint 
              smaller ones. Click Zone-&gt;Toggle Wireframe mode overlay. Now 
              it's easier to see the points.</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCC99">Ok, 
              turn wireframe off. Let's have some fun with gravity! Choose Diagnostics-&gt;Create 
              some spheres. Woah, little blue orbs bouncing around. Try editing 
              the landscape, the balls react to the changes in real-time.</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCC99">It's 
              still a boring landscape. Let's add some trees. Choose Window-&gt;Open 
              Entity Tool. In the entity category pane scroll down and click Trees. 
              On the right (entity pane) scroll down and choose &quot;tree_rich&quot;.</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCC99">Now 
              click on the landscape in a few places. Viola! On the Entity Tool 
              window change the mode to &quot;Move&quot;. Try clicking one of 
              the trees you placed and dragging it around the landscape.</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCC99">Ok, 
              everything is entirely too cheery. Let's get some bad weather going. 
              Choose Fog &amp; Lights-&gt;Weather Preset Manager. </font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCC99">Click 
              Load. Choose 3_storm.wet and click apply. (1 is morning, 2 is noonish 
              and 3 is evening in my weather names btw)</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCC99">It's 
              stormy! Watch and you might actually see a tree get hit by lightning. 
              This is done by the script attached to the tree and the weather 
              script that is causing the rain sound, rain particle system and 
              lightning effects.</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCC99">You 
              should probably change the weather back to &quot;editor.wet&quot; 
              before you forget, otherwise this storm is always going to here 
              when you start it up.</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCC99">Look 
              at the &quot;Log Output&quot; window. You'll probably see a lot 
              of errors about g_id_player missing. That's because the weather 
              script can randomly target the player (lawn mower) and that variable 
              doesn't exist. The editor doesn't include the TLM specific scripting 
              extensions, this is normal. A script can detect weather or not you're 
              in the editor and behave differently, sometimes this is desired 
              so a creature doesn't run around in the editor or things like that.</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCC99">That's 
              it for our little introduction section.</font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>About 
              the Example mod included</b></font> 
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCC99">A 
              simple mod to use as a template has been installed. Run TLM (full 
              version, V1.05 or newer) to play it.</font> 
            <p><font color="#FFFF00" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note:</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              This example mod shows how to run one stand alone level. It only 
              includes a few scripts and relies on many original TLM scripts that 
              are in the main dir. It is also possible to create a whole new TLM 
              story line with all new levels, characters, story complete with 
              saving and loading.</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCC99">It 
              resides in your main TLM dir as \mod\Example. Take a close look 
              at the files. mod_info.txt is required. (text file)</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCC99">The 
              file prepare.bat is just a helper thing showing how to automatically 
              zip up all scripts into one file. (\data\resource.zip. this is hardcoded) 
              You don't NEED to do this but it helps if you plan to distribute 
              the MOD. (you don't need to include the scripts or particle system 
              scripts then)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
              edit the mod: Start up the editor. Now choose Options-&gt;Editor 
              Configuration. Enter &quot;mod\example&quot; without the quotes 
              in the set base path edit box. Choose Ok. It will warn you that 
              changing the base path will lose your work, click ok.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now 
              you see a blank level. Click Zone-&gt;Load and choose Test.zon. 
              This is the level used in the example mod thingie.</font> 
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFF00">Note</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">: 
              An .md2 was included in the &quot;Example&quot; mod just to show 
              how to do it. Not sure who actually made it but hopefully they won't 
              mind us using it in this example.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>About 
              file paths</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
              an entity needs to load 'scripts\tree.c' (while in a mod) this is 
              how the engine will look for it:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Does 
              it exist as &quot;scripts\tree.c?&quot; if not it looks in the mods 
              resource.dat file for 'scripts\tree.c' (which is precached)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
              it's still not found, it does the same checks but in the main game 
              dir rather than the mod dir. This method allows you to replace only 
              one tiny graphic or script or everything in a mod.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only 
              scripts and .pss (particle system scripts) can be read from the 
              resource.dat file.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>About 
              scripts</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Right 
              now, sorry to say I have not had time to write a nice document for 
              the scripting system and likely won't. However, the function names 
              are very descriptive and you should be able to figure it out with 
              these tips and gotchas:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, 
              all scripts are unicode. W2k/XP's notepad.exe can handle unicode 
              files, 98's notepad can't. (Wordpad can, though)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why 
              unicode? To support other languages better, primarily. The font 
              can be changed by script, even complex fonts such as Chinese/Japanese 
              with 6000 characters are supported.</font></p>
            <p><b><font color="#FF0000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Important</font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">: 
              Do not use TAB's in your scripts. If you have a decent editor you 
              can set it to &quot;replace tabs with spaces&quot; so you don't 
              have to worry about it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From 
              your main TLM dir, open data\resource.dat with Winzip and unzip 
              it to your TLM root. (if you did it right, a script and scriptg 
              dir will exist with a lot of scripts in it) These unzipped scripts 
              have a higher priority then the ones in the resource.dat allowing 
              you to easily make changes and see them. (even while you are playing 
              in many cases!)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              TLM scripting system is a lightweight high level scripting system 
              designed for speed of loading, compiling and running a large number 
              of scripts simultaneously. It cannot handle complex math, only allows 
              one command per line and does not support while(), do() or else. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It 
              can handle a large amount of dynamic scripts and variables quickly. 
              (It uses a bucketed hash map for var lookups during the load/compile 
              phase, after the initial compile all vars are direct lookup.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
              supports int, float, vector3 and string types. String memory is 
              dynamically allocated as needed, there are no size limitations in 
              number of vars initted, scripts concurrently running or size of 
              strings other than system memory.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All 
              global variables are saved/loaded when a Save/Load script command 
              is performed. Vars can be used in strings like this: LogMsg(&quot;You 
              are holding $i_cash$ bucks.&quot;);</font></p>
            <p><b><font color="#FF0000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note</font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">: 
              LogMsg() is useful to display debug messages only you can see. From 
              inside the game, press tilde to see the in-game-output log at any 
              time. Running with -debug will have it also logged to disk.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
              print quotes or a dollar sign just put a backslash in front of it. 
              A double backslash is converted to a backslash. A \n is a carriage 
              return.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Local/global 
              vars are supported. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">global 
              int g_i_cash; is a global</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">int 
              g_i_cash; is a local.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Local 
              vars are actually script wide and destroyed when that particular 
              script is destroyed. Usually every item in the game has a script 
              attached.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>About 
              Sub Zones</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sub 
              zones are a very useful concept. Normally, every level must have 
              a sub zone called &quot;Mow&quot;. On a new level you must add this 
              yourself. Be sure to turn the draw style to &quot;Draw Nothing&quot; 
              for this kind of zone.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You 
              can use the Sub Zone tool to paint sub zones. Everywhere painted 
              with the Mow zone will be required to mow and change color when 
              touched.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
              are script commands to 'get a random subzone' block and such that 
              help with spawning things, also you can do simple buildings with 
              zones and paint walls and such on. (not really used in TLM)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hardness 
              blocks let you paint on areas to make them hard, you have to do 
              this for trees and garbage cans and stuff.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>About 
              The Entity Tool</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
              is an entity? It's a dog, a player or a leaf. This tool let's you 
              specify entity types so you can quickly add them to levels later.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Each 
              entity category is saved as an *.ent file in the \data dir. If you 
              drop another .ent file into the dir, it will automatically be loaded. 
              It is possible to give a friend an .ent file you made and the graphics 
              it needs and it will work fine in his editor and levels.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
              editing a mod, any entity changes you make to default entity files 
              will actually save out new *.ent files to your mod dir, thereby 
              the changes will only be active in your mod. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note: 
              You cannot delete entity base template types, only edit them. You 
              can delete the whole .ent file manually and the category will be 
              gone.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Landscape 
              Textures</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
              are two kinds of landscape texturing, base texturing (the bottom 
              layer) and overlay texuring. (a second layer for holes, roads, etc)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
              add/remove landscape textures you must edit the textures.txt file. 
              For a mod, you could start by copying the one from the main \data 
              dir into your mod's \data dir.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overlay 
              textures should have alpha channels to control which parts 'show 
              through'. We prefix our overlay textures with o_ just to help keep 
              things organized.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Distribution 
              of mods</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
              distributing your mod (if you choose to) it would be very nice if 
              you could have it auto install to the correct place by checking 
              the reg key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\RTSOFT\TLM for the path, 
              this is path to the main TLM dir. If you email me I may be able 
              to help you with that. A simple .exe for the end user to click saves 
              sooo much headaches for 'em!</font></p>

            <p></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
              not so obvious feature in the editor is the camera scripting hotkeys. 
              Hitting them prints out some code you can use in your script to 
              set the camera. (saves a lot of time)</font></p>

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shift-p 
              - this prints out code to set the camera target point. The camera 
              will smoothly swoop towards this position and orientation. The positional 
              and angular movement speed can be set by script independently.</font></p>

              debugging</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
              the editor debug information and errors are printed to the log file. 
              While playing the game, the same log is available by hitting ` (tilde). 
              Errors are also output to a file called error.txt in the mod directory. 
              If you specify -debug as a parm when loading the game all normal 
              debug messages will be logged to debug.txt also.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1 (grid 
              overlay) and Ctrl-H (subzone and hardness color overlay) are also 
              available inside the game to aid in debugging.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Acceptable 
              file types</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Image/sprites: 
              dds, bmp, tga, png, jpg, dib and ppm.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFF00" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">: 
              .dds is the fastest to load. It's the DirectDrawSurface format and 
              can include precalculated MIP maps. They must be saved as a power 
              of two, you can get a Photoshop plugin to save this filetype.</font></p>

              Internally MP3's are handled by DirectShow, which is a little flaky. 
              You probably only want to use it for music, not for a bunch of little 
              sound effects. The MP3 format is not used for TLM's music for licensing 
              reasons. </font></p>

              demo version of TLM can't run mods and the editor will give a lot 
              of errors if you try to load resources that only exist in the full 
              game.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
              editor/tlm engine is not really setup to do anything other than 
              lawn mowing levels, if you want to do anything radically different 
              such as an RPG I would recommend waiting for some new stuff we're 
              working on, but by all means you're welcome to make any kind of 
              MOD you want.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some 
              options in the editor are disabled such as &quot;Create human&quot;. 
              I disabled these because I didn't want to include the extra art 
              needed to use them or the feature isn't ready yet.</font></p>

/*
 * A fancy pants profiler (version 1.2)
 * 
 * This source code is based on Steve Rabin's article
 * "Real-Time In-Game Profiling" from the book Game
 * Programming Gems <http://www.gameprogramminggems.com>
 *
 * Changed around a bit by Matthijs Hollemans
 * <matthijs@shakeyourass.org>
 *
 * This is how you use the profiler:
 *
 *    1. Add the files "profile.h," "profile.cpp,"
 *       "timer.h," and "timer.cpp" to your project.
 *
 *    2. In the source(s) that you want to profile,
 *       first #define the symbol ENABLE_PROFILER,
 *       and then include "profile.h". Without this 
 *       symbol defined, the PROFILE_* macros are 
 *       empty, and the profiler code won't execute. 
 *
 *    3. Structure your main loop like this:
 *
 *           PROFILE_INIT
 *       
 *           while (!finished)
 *           {
 *               PROFILE_BEGIN("Main loop")
 *       
 *               PROFILE_BEGIN("Do stuff")
 *               ... do stuff ...
 *               PROFILE_END("Do stuff")
 *       
 *               PROFILE_BEGIN("Do other stuff")
 *               ... do other stuff ...
 *               PROFILE_END("Do other stuff")
 *       
 *               ... do main stuff ...
 *       
 *               PROFILE_END("Main loop")
 *               PROFILE_TALLY
 *           }
 *
 *       PROFILE_INIT must be called once before the
 *       main loop starts; it sets up the profiler and
 *       initializes the high-resolution timer. 
 * 
 *       Inside the loop, you wrap the pieces of code 
 *       that you want to measure inside PROFILE_BEGIN 
 *       and PROFILE_END blocks, giving each of these 
 *       sample points a unique name. 
 *
 *       Don't forget to call PROFILE_TALLY at the end 
 *       of each iteration. This turns the measurements
 *       into a bunch of statistics.
 *
 *    4. Provide the following two functions:
 * 
 *           void profile_clear_buffer(void);
 *           void profile_write_buffer(const char* text);
 *
 *       These are called by PROFILE_TALLY, and should
 *       be used to write the profile statistics into
 *       some kind of text buffer or log file.

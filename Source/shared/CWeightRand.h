//Class to let you use random on objects that you want to appear at certain frequencies. 
//For instance, you could enter the letters of the alphabets with their frequency in english
//usage and get nice numbers for a word game. (E will pop up much more than Z, etc)

//example of usage:

CWeightRand rand;
rand.AddChoice(0, 6);
//the second number is the 'weighting' It's compared to the other choices' weights.
//If you had only two choices, and they were weighted 1 and 10, the 10 one would
// get chosen 90% of the time.
rand.AddChoice(1, 6);
rand.AddChoice(2, 2); 

int i_choice = rand.GetRandom();
